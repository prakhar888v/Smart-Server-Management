# Smart-Server-Management
I built some daemon processes and a clustering analysis script to manage server load in real time.
The daemon process utilizes a prediction library to predict server load in the future. 
The prediction library works in predicting continous variables using exponential smoothing technique and can directly connect with a database instance to fetch data.
